- React js
- CSS
- Material UI 
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Jest for unit testing

## Functionalities
- Upload photos
- Like/Unlike a photo
- Search for a photo
- Search for a user
- Add, edit, and delete a comment from a photo
- Add an album
- Edit cover photo and description of album
- View favorites 
- View other profiles
- Change account settings (password)
- Add/edit your bio
- Explore

## Future work
- Make a whole refactoring for the favoriting and unfavoriting logic of a photo, as not always the requests are being sent correctly.
- Implement the remaining functionalities such as follow and notifications, as these features could add the sense of a real social networking app.
- Implement the Groups feature to enhance the communication between the users of our website.
